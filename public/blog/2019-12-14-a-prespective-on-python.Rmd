I was first introduced to computer programing through python. As I gradually became a better programer, I started working with R. At first I was bewildered by the languages high functionality and intricacies. Compared to python R seemed like a mess, unsure of what it really wanted to be. However, the more I became fimilar with R I realized it's usefullness. Particulary, the R community is organized, connected, and receptive. Python on the otherhand feels often cold and disconnected. That being said, both languages can produce strikingly similar results.

```{r}
head(faithful)

# the standard deviation of the variable eruptions when waiting is less than the median
sd(faithful[faithful$waiting < median(faithful$waiting),"eruptions"])

# the standard deviation of the variable eruptions when waiting is greater than the median
sd(faithful[faithful$waiting > median(faithful$waiting),"eruptions"])

# conversion to minutes
faithful$eruptions_m <- faithful$eruptions/60
faithful$waiting_m <- faithful$waiting/60
head(faithful)

plot(faithful$eruptions, faithful$waiting,
 main = "Eruption Time vs Waiting Time",
 xlab = "Eruptions (min)",
 ylab = "Waiting (min)")
```



```{python, python.reticulate = FALSE}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

faithful=pd.read_csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/datasets/faithful.csv")

print(faithful.head())

# the standard deviation of the variable eruptions when waiting is less than the median
print(np.std(faithful[faithful.waiting < np.median(faithful.waiting)].eruptions))

# the standard deviation of the variable eruptions when waiting is greater than the median
print(np.std(faithful[faithful.waiting > np.median(faithful.waiting)].eruptions))

# conversion to minutes 
faithful['eruptions_h'] = (faithful['eruptions']/60)
faithful["waiting_h"] = (faithful["waiting"]/60)
print(faithful.head())

plt.scatter(faithful["waiting"],faithful["eruptions"])
plt.title("Eruption Time vs Waiting Time")
plt.xlabel("Eruptions (min)")
plt.ylabel("Waiting (min)")
plt.show()


```
